Please test this firmware and let us know if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!
This is a modified version of Marlin 2.0.6.1 that allows the NEOPIXEL2_PIN to be independently controlled with a M150 Sn command. Also allows a PWM speaker play music from a song.h file with the use of a M330 command <--- this is most likly the most usless feature to add

## Marlin 2.0 Prototype NeoMarlin-EXTREME Branch that added music

__Not for production use. Use with caution! Use with more NEOPIXELS!!! and Use with a PWM Speakers__

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
